# 7-Days-of-AI-Coding
A place to store my projects from **#7DaysofAICoding** from [100 School](https://www.100school.com/)

This repository is for my adventures with the [7 Days of AI Coding Challenge](https://www.100school.com/atomic-challenges/7daysofaicoding)

What is 7 Days of AI Coding, you ask? It's an opportunity to learn AI coding in just 7 days, with free, fun, and effective 30-minute bite-sized lessons delivered daily to guide your AI journey.

You can see what I did for each day below ðŸ‘‡

Day1: [AI-Generated Landing Page](https://thebimsider.github.io/7-Days-of-AI-Coding/Day1) This landing page uses [FormSubmit](https://formsubmit.co/) to handle the subscription, great free option.   
Day2: [Brick by Brick - AI Generated Game](https://thebimsider.github.io/7-Days-of-AI-Coding/Day2) I used Claude to create this Hangman style word game of Buzzwords.
