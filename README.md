This repository is for my adventures with the [7 Days of AI Coding Challenge](https://www.100school.com/atomic-challenges/7daysofaicoding)

What is 7 Days of AI Coding, you ask? It's an opportunity to learn AI coding in just 7 days, with free, fun, and effective 30-minute bite-sized lessons delivered daily to guide your AI journey.
