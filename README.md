# 7-Days-of-AI-Coding
A place to store my projects from **#7DaysofAICoding** from [100 School](https://www.100school.com/)

This repository is for my adventures with the [7 Days of AI Coding Challenge](https://www.100school.com/atomic-challenges/7daysofaicoding)

What is 7 Days of AI Coding, you ask? It's an opportunity to learn AI coding in just 7 days, with free, fun, and effective 30-minute bite-sized lessons delivered daily to guide your AI journey.

You can see what I did for each day below ðŸ‘‡

Day1: [AI-Generated Landing Page](https://thebimsider.github.io/7-Days-of-AI-Coding/Day1) This landing page uses [FormSubmit](https://formsubmit.co/) to handle the subscription, great free option.   
Day2: [Brick by Brick - AI Generated Game](https://thebimsider.github.io/7-Days-of-AI-Coding/Day2) I used Claude to create this Hangman style word game of Buzzwords.   
Day3: [Brick by Brick V2.0 Now Responsive](https://thebimsider.github.io/7-Days-of-AI-Coding/Day3) Used Claude to improve yesterday's code, now playable on mobile!    
Day4-a: [Pomodoro timer - Artifact](https://claude.site/artifacts/5ca0a1ab-0767-4078-b2c7-4b181d5528ca) I used Claude to make a Pomodoro timer and publish as Artifact   
Day4-b: [Pomodoro timer - GitHub Pages](https://thebimsider.github.io/7-Days-of-AI-Coding/Day4) Same Pomodoro timer app from Claude but GitHub Pages version
